Teaching is hard at any career stage

--

but especially starting.

# `r fa("far fa-compass", fill = "#fff")` Beginning Teachers

```{r, out.width = "680px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

Social media tools offer new opportunities for beginning teachers

--

but also introduce new challenges.

---

# `r fa("far fa-compass", fill = "#fff")` Beginning Teachers

```{r, out.width = "680px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

```

Beginning teachers must juggle more competing voices 

--

and for ongoing learning of what and how to teach.

Professional development can't keep up,

--

so self-directed learning is more important than ever.

```

**Design:**

--

---

# `r fa("fas fa-screwdriver-wrench", fill = "#fff")` Method

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/game-dev.png")
```

**Participants:**

--

- FSU alumni (*n* = 5)

--

- Science teachers in Florida (across middle and high school)

--

- First or second year of teaching

--

- Active social media users

---

# `r fa("fas fa-screwdriver-wrench", fill = "#fff")` Method

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/writing.jpg")
```

**Data Collection:** (March to May 2022)

--

- 8 weeks of **diary entries** reflecting upon social media use

--

- Pre- and post-**interviews**

--

---

# `r fa("fas fa-screwdriver-wrench", fill = "#fff")` Method

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/colors.jpg")
```

**Data Analysis:**

--

- Thematic analysis of diary entries and interview transcripts

--

- CAST framework + emergent codes

**Ginny**

--

- First-year 8th-grade science teacher in a public school

--

- TeachersPayTeachers.com (TPT), TikTok, and YouTube for professional learning

---

# `r fa("fas fa-person-chalkboard", fill = "#fff")` Results

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/game-dev.png")

**Sarah**

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/game-dev.png")
```

**Both Ginny and Sarah**

--

- Social aspect of SDL very important, but based in school

--

- Social media tools were a secondary outlet for SDL

--

- Social media tools were for finding resources and ideas for instruction as well as staying updated on what is happening 

---

# `r fa("fas fa-magnifying-glass", fill = "#fff")` Results

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/game-dev.png")
```

--

**RQ1. What social media sources for SDL?**

--

- TeachersPayTeachers.com (TPT), TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram

--

- But SDL spanned online and local, with in-school being primary

---

# `r fa("fas fa-magnifying-glass", fill = "#fff")` Results

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/game-dev.png")
```

**Usefulness of SDL through social media:**

--

- Getting the broad perspectives

--

- Efficiently finding ideas and resources 

---

# `r fa("fas fa-magnifying-glass", fill = "#fff")` Results

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/game-dev.png")
```

**Limits of SDL through social media:**

--

- Maintaining social boundaries around social media use

---

# `r fa("fas fa-magnifying-glass", fill = "#fff")` Results

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/game-dev.png")
```

**Limits of SDL through social media:**

- Finding time to locate and adapt resources

---

# `r fa("fas fa-magnifying-glass", fill = "#fff")` Results

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/game-dev.png")
```

**Limits of SDL through social media:**

- Determining quality and relevancy of instructional resources found through social media

---

# `r fa("fas fa-magnifying-glass", fill = "#fff")` Results

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/game-dev.png")
```


**RQ2. What effect on instructional practice?**

--

- More often, **noninstructional** impacts: 

--

  - stress relief, staying informed, prompts for self-reflection

---

# `r fa("fas fa-magnifying-glass", fill = "#fff")` Results

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/game-dev.png")
```


**RQ2. What effect on instructional practice?**

- Some **instructional** impacts: 

--

  - being inspired by and getting resources from other teachers 

--

  - but, generally limited in scope

--

- Literature describes lots possibilities for SDL through social media,

--

- but this is not evident here.

---

# `r fa("fas fa-person-chalkboard", fill = "#fff")` Discussion

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

```

- Do they know how? 

--

- Are they interested? 

--

- Do they have capacity?

---

# `r fa("fas fa-person-chalkboard", fill = "#fff")` Discussion

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/SDL.png")
```

- Across 13 chances (8 weeks of diary entries and 5 interviews), SDL through social media was very limited

--

- Getting a few ideas for classroom management, warm-up activities, lesson resources that needed to be modified. 

---

# `r fa("fas fa-person-chalkboard", fill = "#fff")` Discussion

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/SDL.png")
```

- Did not look for mentors, seek out feedback, or test new ideas

--

- Solitary, information-retrieval approach than a community-oriented one

--

- Some affordances of social media were maximized while others were neglected

--

1. SDL is an essential skill for teachers at all career stages

--

2. SDL should be viewed as part of a professional development **ecosystem**

3. SDL is a voluntary effort that should be acknowledged and supported
